In a world where technological progress has connected people all over the world, one can observe strengths and weaknesses in others and realize that we all have similar experiences. This self-help book on 22 Data Science case studies discusses common topics ranging from disaster, long-term goals, self-esteem, and lack of technological regulatory rules. Insightful ideas and existing Data Science techniques are discussed as a possible way to solve everyday problems, such that people can be more educated, make better decisions, and live their “happy life”. Five key self-help activities on goal achievement, self-sabotage, decision making, and overcoming unwanted emotions are given so that readers can empower their own lives.
