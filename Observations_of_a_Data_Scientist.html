    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">To all the people, systems, and structures that helped me to be an accomplished educated person in the field of Data Science. As I have been taught to succeed with my life path and be responsible for myself, I hope this information helps others to be more aware of themselves and others, and succeed with their chosen life path.
      <br><br>
      “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants” (Isaac Newton). 
      <br><br>
      Taking responsibility for our own experiences and choices, allows us to use technology responsibly and thus “stand on the shoulders of Giants” such that we can advance without destroying ourselves.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">PREFACE: In a world where technological progress has connected people all over the world, one can observe strengths and weaknesses in others and realize that we all have similar experiences. This self-help book on 22 Data Science case studies discusses common topics ranging from disaster, long-term goals, self-esteem, and lack of technological regulatory rules. Insightful ideas and existing Data Science techniques are discussed as a possible way to solve everyday problems, such that people can be more educated, make better decisions, and live their “happy life”. Five key self-help activities on goal achievement, self-sabotage, decision making, and overcoming unwanted emotions are given so that readers can empower their own lives. The Data Science Workflows are webapps containing Large Language Model (LLM) data-driven horoscope-like applications, that help users have clarity on their lives based on their own data. So instead of relying on horoscopes, tarot cards, angel cards, and dreams to solve your daily-life problems, try using a factual data-driven source like the LLM and create your own destiny with your own data and good decision-making.

    <h1 id="observation0_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 0: Disaster and Data</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p id="observation0_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">
      Disaster occurs when people, objects, and/or things are transformed in an unproductive manner. The dictionary definition of "destroy" is "to reduce (an object) to useless fragments, a useless form, or remains, as by rending, burning, or dissolving; injure beyond repair or renewal; demolish; ruin; annihilate" [1]. Destruction can take the form of many behaviors, including: physical destruction of life (ie: violence), physical destruction of material property (ie: breaking a PC because you did not win at a video game), destruction of mental health (ie: excessive competition, harassment, self-sabotage). 
      <br><br>
      When one lives a life influenced by disaster and destruction it means that:</p>
<ol id="observation0_para_part1" style="display:none; text-align: left;">
<li>one can not control their brain in a self-productive manner, such that they can think logically and calmly without being triggered by strong emotions.
<li>one acts as if they do not want a future by: creating no short and long-term goals, having no self-improvement, not acquiring objects (ie: money, car, home) and/or titles of value and significance.  Accomplishments, created by daily actions, show that one has a future in our society. It is very difficult to create nothing and/or destroy everything, and suddenly start over again and catch-up to the current level of modern society; it takes decades or more to build stable structures. Destroying one's things or having no ambition to accomplish something creates no future.
<li>one desire no self-improvement for themselves or others. Figuratively speaking, one desires nothing except "dirt and ash", which is all that is left after significant disaster and destruction events. Another parallel of destruction of property, is "returning to nature or a simplistic way of living" in an advanced technological age. It is not logical or productive for the evolution of human civilization to return to using simplistic methods 100 years ago, after having advanced scientific understanding of our environment and ourselves. When a person graduates from university, do they return to elementary school to learn how to read? One does not, one in fact values and improves upon what they learned before, accumulating all of the knowledge.
<li>one lives in the past because everyone who does not destroy their things are constantly creating, working together, and advancing to the future; unfortunately leaving behind people who destroy themselves and others around them. Feelings of revenge and competition are often fostered by those who were "left behind", unwillingly causing themselves to repeat an endless cycle of destructive behavior.
<li>one becomes less connected to reality due to fear and lack of interest in building a productive future and life; they become isolated and have less access to modern technology.
<li>one creates limited mental beliefs of what they can and can not do because they do not understand the full range of possible choices that are available. In short many people whom experience disaster/destruction in their life lack education about the activities that they are involved in, poor life decisions are often made without up-to-date knowledge about societal related activities and career.
</ol>
<p id="observation0_para_part2" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Creation and destruction are similar to the Birth and Death cycle in numerical modeling, people who destroy are likely to die-out due to lack and those who create are likely to survive due to growth and improvement. I have observed that many people who have had disaster or tremendous loss in their life, have anger and resentment for their losses, making violence and destruction justified. Therefore, just by being exposed to unfortunate situations, it is human nature to repeat destruction in some form (ie: vandalism, abuse, harassment). People exposed to disaster may influence people to destroy things, simply due to conditioned behavior that everyone deems as normal.
<br><br>
Not only is disaster a physical phenomenon, it has lasting physical and psychological effects. Physical and psychological effects include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gastro-intestinal disorders [2]. By understanding which features/factors are involved with disaster, perhaps individual change and self-empowerment can be obtained by simple day-to-day behaviors related to reversing disaster exposure behavior.</p>

    <h2 id="observation1_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 1: Self-evolution through transformation</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p id="observation1_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">We all have unfortunate experiences in our lives, it is a choice to transform these experiences into something positive or “run away” from them. “Running away” could include avoidance, distraction from the unfortunate situation by over focusing on something else, or asking someone else to solve the situation for you. Transforming the situation implies understanding the situation (context, cause and effect), and then taking logical steps to change the outcome in a controlled manner. The act of transforming unfortunate experiences into positive experiences consists of three steps:</p>
    <ol id="observation1_para_part1" style="display:none; text-align: left;">
    <li> try to understand the problem using cause-and-effect thinking of actions that create responses,
    <li> be able to control and direct one’s emotional state despite the current situation,
    <li> long-term monitoring of cause-and-effect thinking of actions that create responses, and synthesizing key information that create better life-situations.
    </ol>
    <p id="observation1_para_part2" style="display:none; text-align: left;">
    Step 1 is a Data Science principle, called finding key features to understand system function, thus allowing one to predict and control future outcomes. This Data Science principle can be used in the context of daily-life, such that one needs to find key actions (ie: features) to understand their life (ie: system function) thus allowing one to predict and control future life outcomes. Successful and happy people have learned which actions cause certain life-outcomes, and they repeatedly choose specific actions to create or control desired future goals. Successful and happy people are considered in society as people who "know themselves", because they understand their "Data Science system function" or action-response relationships in their life. Learn about the your daily-life problem/s by testing an action and observing a response. Actions can be as simple as taking a different way at work or learning a new hobby. After performing these "test actions", observe the effects in your life; keep a log listing the action and its corresponding effect in your life with respect to the problem/s. By understanding the cause and effect relationship with one’s problems, one can slowly improve and positively transform one’s life by identifying and controlling key actions to obtain desired outcomes. 
    <br><br>
    Understanding cause-and-effect observations of action-response takes time because action-response data needs to be collected (ie: logging action-response outcomes) and patterns need to be understood, therefore do not be discouraged that your life will not positively changed over-night. Thus, as mentioned in Step 2, maintaining a hopeful and neutral emotional state is key to obtaining one's desired life goals, because it enables logical observation of action-response patterns and good decision making. In addition to being hopeful and not influenced by strong emotions, it is important to be self-motivated and focused on one's daily objectives. In order to maintain a self-motivated state, it is recommended that one constantly focus upon at least one positive realistic long-term goal. Having a continuous long-term objective in mind allows one to maintain focus on their goal instead of being distracted, thus increasing the probability of achieving the goal. What one thinks about constantly is generally what one does, says, and who one is. By staying hopeful, emotionally calm, and focusing on objectives, you will not have time nor even think about being discouraged about your life not yet being in a desired state. You will feel that your life is incrementally advancing just by maintaining these mental objectives. 
    <br><br>
    Finally in Step 3, it is important to adopt a long-term action-response strategy for solving daily-life problems to make long-lasting change. Short-term help from others may improve a problem temporarily but the problem is likely to reoccur because action-response patterns that caused the original problem were not changed. Many people have problems that orignate from themselves because we perform actions that create certain responses, one’s experiences and perception of the world creates the opportunities in one’s life.  
    <br><br>
    In Data Science, a long-term system monitoring strategy is called Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) or Developement Operations (DevOps). Machine Learning is a scientific field where data-driven predictive models provide users with probablistic results of certain outcomes. MLOps monitors long-term changes in model prediction based on new data, and retrains the model when baseline data trends change such that users can have accurate predictions based on their data [1]. Similarly, DevOps is the process of making a software system available to many users and long-term changes are monitored in order to give targeted feedback to users of the system [2]. Continually synthesizing the observations of action-response such that key actions/features/factors for one’s problems are identified, is important to change the outcome of the situation with learned feedback, and thus have a more stable life (ie: a more stable model for MLOps, a more stable system for DevOps).
    <br><br>
    Transition to the future! As you understand the underlying action-response patterns in your life, move away from unsuccessful patterns, and adopt more life-fulfilling patterns, new ideas, life desires, and long-term goals are likely to arise. Also, be aware that your thoughts, personality/character, and/or perspective may evolve too. As a result of character and perspective change due to self transformation, ideas and concepts that were exciting and funny before, may be less exciting and funny because a new view-point and understanding of the consequences with respect to the old view-point were realized. For example, laughing at someone falling due to miscoordination may have been funny before understanding that falling down could happen to anyone and it is a common event that is not surprising or exciting, it is a painful event that requires prevention; once these simple ideas are realized laughing is not interesting and other responses are adopted.
    <br><br>
    In the Data Science Workflow below, make a schedule to evolve your life from one life-path to another desired life-path. By having a daily schedule of what objectives are required to obtain a desired life, short-term and long-term planning to make stable lasting change is manageable.</p>

    <h2 id="observation2_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 2: Ironic Importance of debit</h2>

    <p id="observation2_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Debit, lack of something, makes one realize the available choices that they can make. Debit is an adjective that has a connotation associated with money and finance, but debit could be applied to any subject such as opportunity or creativity.
“Opportunity debit”, scarcity of opportunities, is a common phenomenon that happens to everyone. It generally means that one is not surrounding themselves with people that have the same expectations and knowledge as them; there is misalignment of intention and interest. The best way to solve opportunity debit is to participate in events and activities that align with the desired expectations of the opportunity. For example, if one wants to be a Data Scientist, participate in Data Science blogs, classes, group analysis sites like Kaggle, online conferences, bootcamps if you are lucky, and anything related to the subject of Data Science.
The more one participates with the topic of the opportunity that is desired, the more likely the opportunity is possible. One can use the expression ‘Fake it until you make it’ because one is performing the actions and intentions to obtain the skills for the desired opportunity.
The least effective way to solve “opportunity debit” is to focus on the disaster, hate of lack, and negative emotions for not being accepted for things that are desired in life. People who have already been accepted in the things that you want to do are happy and they do not want to be around sad and negative people, they just want to do the activity like you. It is not effective to “show up to the door” of a group of people who you want to join in a negative, hateful, and angry state. People will just focus on the emotions and not even focus on the activity (ie: job, etc). Carrying around hateful negative emotions makes one: not lead a normal life, have limited social and financial opportunities, not have a future to look forward to living, not have long-term happiness.</p>

    <h2 id="observation3_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 3: Help me with my life</h2>

    <p id="observation3_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Many people ask other people to help them with their life, directly and indirectly. However, when does asking for help render one too dependent on others, where they do not take personal responsibility for their proper life? Many people do not realize that they are “helped” all the time with their life, simply by the fact that they exist and participate in life activities like getting an education. All the problems in their life are secret ways for them to have help, created with their “own hands”. Most people “run away” from the problems in their life and GIVE them to OTHER PEOPLE instead of embarrassing them and unraveling them such that they can find the “secret help”.
If you can not find a job, it is “secret help” to tell you that you are doing something wrong at that time. Wrong does not mean good or bad, is just means that there is a conflict. One needs to follow the steps to understand what they should do correctly, in order to obtain the things that they need and want in life. Brainstorming, reading/watching many sources of information, learning new things, and practicing everyday is necessary to find the “secret help” in one’s problems.
I personally do not like to write about myself, but I could not find a job for years despite having a solid education in a Data Science related-field and many short-term internships and postdoctorates using Data Science tools. As someone who strongly values education, I immediately thought that the problem was my lack of education in the field so I started taking training courses, participating in any online activities related to Data Science, I read Data Science blogs and even started my own Data Science code blog, and much more. With every new activity/choice that I COMPLETED with respect to improving my Data Science profile, a new activity/door appeared on the blogs or I found it searching for more and more advanced topics. Despite the fact that I still can not find a job even though I apply to jobs weekly, which is a form of asking for “help” in a respectable manner of accepted service, I believe that I am one of the best versions of myself that I could be because I take responsibility for my situation and constantly try to improve the things in my life that have value for future success. If I had “ran away”, complained, or became depressed about the situation I would have a lot less in my life, with or without a job.
Additionally, I think it is important to use one’s own things present in their life, instead of enviously wishing that you had the accomplishments and things that peers, friends, and family have. The fact that one has peers, friends, and family that are successful just means that you have the potential to accomplish similar things with your own things and opportunities in your own life. Social media sites like LinkedIn and Facebook measure one’s potential for success based on the success of their peers, friends, and family. When peers, friends, or family accomplish success the marketing of the social media site often automatically contacts their social network to notify others that they could have more potential for success too. This form of marketing biases successful people to have more friends, and less successful people to have less friends; it encourages comparing one’s self with other people, strong focus on the successful person’s life, and often generates jealousy, negative judgment, hatred, and envy of the successful person instead of motivating others to fulfill their potential. One’s lack of success with using their opportunities does give them the liberty to take the things and opportunities of more successful peers, friends, and family by unconsciously wishing for their lack of success. One should use the success of others to motivate themselves to utilize their own resources more efficiently such that they can equally obtain success too. If you have university peers that are Data Scientist, but you are having a hard time becoming a confirmed Data Scientist, it just means that you have the potential to be a Data Scientist and you need to use your own resources more efficiently. It does not mean that you should wish misfortune on your Data Science peers, and then contact them such that you can copy everything that they did to obtain the title yourself. Unraveling the “secret help” from your life problems is performing the correct actions for your life path to advance yourself. Peer success provides a proven measure that you can accomplish the same success, and it gives guidance for what activities to engage in; the experience of doing the same activity (learning, reflection) will be different for each person because each person is different but the competence outcome will be similar.</p>

    <h2 id="observation4_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 4: Can one be different from their PAST?</h2>

    <p id="observation4_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Things that one has learned, seen, and experienced are things that repeat in one’s life. One can not do or even think of doing something if one has not been exposed to it in some way. 
    People who have past family histories of disaster and atrocity, like war and slavery, tell stories of the horrible events that happened to their children. It is positive to teach future generations about past history such that better future decision making can be made. And, it is also positive to understand one’s ancestry, and know where one comes from. However, there is a fine line where “history telling” of disaster becomes destructive. Children who are indoctrinated about past disasters are going to unconsciously recreate details about the disaster situation in their life, through unconscious thinking processes connected to memory. It is more likely that a child that was told family stories about slavery or war injustices is going to focus on injustices in their life, than a child that was not told these stories.
    Watching films that realize historical disaster events, cultural and racial, may also have effects on perception of one’s treatment in their real-life. It is easier to repeat what was seen, said, heard, and experienced, than interpreting/analyzing the significance of what was observed without any direct connection to their life. Similar to visiting a museum or art exhibition, one does not directly correlate their real-life with the objects observed. Museum observers typically interpret and analyze the significance of the events and objects, but film observers often embody the events and stories that are told, copying the events that happened in films and/or stories in real-life in a certain manner.
    It is more constructive to watch a film as entertainment with no direct implication to one’s life, than to associate one’s life with the injustices and events in a film. Unconsciously copying and recreating past historical disasters, due to excessive exposure and lack of abstract interpretation, may be linked to depression, misperception of reality, and social-economic dysfunction.</p>

    <h2 id="observation5_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 5: Rational versus instinctive response in different contexts</h2>

    <p id="observation5_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">There is fear of living things that move that we do not understand because we can not predict their behavior; it is an instinctive concept that an entity that can take action has the potential to do harm. Many people are afraid of insects, snakes, animals, and even people because of unfamiliarity. Fear can cause people to respond in irrational and destructive ways. For example, instead of capturing an insect, snake, or rat and letting it free outside, the natural instinct is to kill it before it irrationally “jumps on you”, signifying that it “kills you”. These irrational fear crises, caused by insignificant and helpless things are usually followed by feelings of sadness because we know that it was unnecessary. Instinctive patterns that were important before for human survival, like “killing it before it kills you”, may be considered irrational and cruel due to modernisation and control of the environment. In order to be rational, many people adopt a strategy of learning what insects, animals, and humans are dangerous, and they only harm dangerous insects, animals, and humans that are dangerous to human life. 
    From another rational perspective, targeting dangerous individual creature behavior is not enough for ecosystem safety because there are entire species of living creatures that can cause chaos and harm if they are not controlled. For example, a fly generally can not harm you but they do not respect different areas and can contaminate food with dangerous bacteria and/or viruses, causing sickness. Similarly, mosquitos cause widespread disease like malaria. 
    Living together in a shared and semi-controlled environment, an ecosystem with different levels of intelligent life, is not completely free of danger. The more that we control things in our environment we need to be more observant, rational, and considerate of different contexts; behavior in one environment may be positive but behavior in another environment may be dangerous and negative.</p>

    <h2 id="observation6_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 6: Encouragement for exaggeration</h2>

    <p id="observation6_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Society encourages excitement and exaggeration of behavior because of our media driven culture.
    We live in a world where ‘the story’ in the media that is most exciting, meaning that participation is maximized, is deemed a success for publicity.
    However could tragedy and disaster be minimized if society did not encourage excitement, exaggeration, and gossip? From a global viewpoint, social exaggeration may cause groups of the population to live in their own imaginary worlds, created by past history and reinforce stereotypes. Societal exaggeration may be a slow, long-term factor/feature that may lead to long-term behavior (aggression, violence, happiness).
    A measure that quantifies societal, organizational, and individual exaggeration could be helpful for society to have better CONTEXT and awareness of their actions with respect to others. It could be beneficial to both people who do not exaggerate and those whom do.
    To prevent the ‘cry wolf syndrome’, where the things that exaggerators say are not believed by other people, an exaggeration measure that everyone can trust could help to prevent tragedy for people who lie/exaggerate often; people would believe an exaggerator when they told the truth. An exaggeration measure could also be therapeutic feedback for people who do not know when their behavior could harm others or themselves.</p>

    <h2 id="observation7_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 7: Discriminatory revenge creates no future</h2>

    <p id="observation7_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Everyone has been discriminated against, whether it be caused by sex, skin color, hair color, social-economic status, education level, etc.
    In my opinion, discriminatory events happen due to many different factors, but the most logical reason for discrimination is to maintain the function of an existing structure. Successful structures have a limited number of participatory spots, not everyone can do the same task in the world nor can everyone work at the same company. If a large number of people worked for the same company it would then be called a “country”, and even a country needs workers to have diverse working skills or else everyone would starve and have nowhere to live or nothing to wear. Discrimination exists because there needs to be rules for organizing people into categories such that existing social-economic structures can continue to function.
    Discrimination is as “good” and “bad” as the rules/criteria that people create to organize people into categories such that functional structures can thrive (ie: gain economic wealth). In the past, people decided on different participatory selection criteria that we now understand to be in-factual and unfair, such as appearance and family history. Without considering education and environment (home-life, neighbors, access to healthcare, disease-free), it is logical that someone with different colored skin can be taught and trained to do the same task. Similarly, if one’s parents were less educated does not imply that their children can not be educated.
    Participatory selection criteria for everything in life has become more and more fair with continued research, technological measures, and educational advancement. Education (ability to read, write, and think logically) is used as standard criteria for selecting individuals for employment; education has been made a forced criteria for all children, all over the world, such that everyone has a fair chance for participating in society with a chosen role.
    Statistics show that people are more educated and have more access to health and happiness today, than in the past. It is a mystery to me, why people complain about past injustices and discriminatory criteria when functional structures are trying to make participatory societal criteria even more fair and just. All people have to do is select a few activities that they are interested in performing for their life, and educate themselves with the guidance of societal structures that are already put in place. If people find that certain existing societal steps/activities are unjust, they can give constructive feedback directly to societal structures for why the step/activity was unjust, while being proactive to continue despite the difficulty. Constructive feedback, such as letters and questionnaires, are constantly used to improve existing societal structures. And, no one should expect that existing processes are perfect, decision making and humanity are evolving and improving constantly because we are imperfect. The constructive feedback that we give today will take time to implement, and these fair structures will be in place for the next generations; one must keep working through the imperfection in order for the future to be more fair, just like our ancestors did for us. We are all “...standing on the shoulders of Giants” (Isaac Newton) because the people before us accepted imperfection, and were motivated to improve what they had.
    From logical deduction, people who complain about injustices assume that societal structures should be perfect, they expect perfection of those around them before they are willing to work. Nothing will ever be perfect, life implies imperfection and improvement; people who expect perfection before working will not work as hard and they will perceive more experiences as negative, thus leading to a mindset of “No Future”/injustice. Working through the imperfection does not mean that one has a horrible life, it just means that one needs to be active and responsible for themselves and the things that they are doing. The things that they may be asked to participate in may not be 100 percent correct, so one needs to adapt and be motivated to make the activities function successfully instead of complaining about the problems.</p>

    <h2 id="observation8_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 8: Preciousness of life and context</h2>

    <p id="observation8_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">One can feel the presence, anger, frustration, and hate of the general environment. People’s behavior, driven by their underlying thoughts, cause the environment to feel positive or negative. When the environment feels violent, there is an expectation of something, usually improvements in their life situation without clearly knowing what their choices are; people just want FAST HELP from somewhere without taking responsibility for the decisions that they made or acceptance of their situation. Some people are given more difficult lives to live than others, sometimes even if one makes all the decisions correctly they are still treated poorly in their life. I think there are a lot of people that have lives like this, so in this case just be active of the things that you can do in your life, take responsibility of your life situation, and focus on the cause of your problems. Life is hard and life is what you make it.
    By watching the news everyday, I see people creating more problems than fixing the problems by trying to “be kind and understanding”. There is confusion about the preciousness of life and the context. For example, in a recent situation with a man that was killed by the police, people focused on death and the preciousness of life WITHOUT thinking about why he was even in that situation (the CONTEXT). Everyday, we all practice ‘doing the things we want to become’. And, the man did things that put himself in that dangerous situation; the police keep societal order and they are punished severely if they are not just or correct. By people saying the man’s death is ‘shocking and horrible’ means that everyone is focusing too much on the ‘preciousness of life’ than the things he did in his life that caused those things to happen. It means that people are not taking responsibility for the things that the man did to put himself in that situation.
    It seems logical that if people focused on and said things about the root problem (why he was there, why he did not act calm, why did he not talk to people normally, why did he not take responsibility for the things that he did instead of running away), then people would have more CONTEXT and not respond violently. By focusing on the root problem, it could also help everyone who is living very challenging lives to focus on their root problems, instead of just being angry and DESTROYING THINGS because ‘life sucks in their opinion’.
    I personally do not participate in things that I disagree with, saying you ACCEPT/SUPPORT irresponsible situations means you AGREE WITH/SUPPORT the things (violence, running away from problems instead of facing them). And, if you ACCEPT/SUPPORT irresponsible situations you get MORE OF THEM ALL THE TIME. The things that you ACCEPT/SUPPORT are the THINGS IN YOUR LIFE. It seems logical that TALKING OUT your problems neutrally and having others LISTEN WITH NO JUDGMENT and honest desire to solve them, may be a good way to solve problems.
    The man unfortunately died because he was irresponsible. The people on the illegal boat all died because they and the people who let them on the boat were irresponsible; people normally do not get on transportation that is not approved to be safe. People who see these horrible things, that are removed from the situation, just think it was a tragedy instead of looking at the ROOT CAUSE and the CONTEXT. Why do all these tragedies happen?</p>

    <h2 id="observation11_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 11: The lack of value for things</h2>
    
    <p id="observation11_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">As physical products, both technological and non-technological, become more commonplace people appear to be forgetting to care for their things and/or manufacturers make products that have a fixed product lifespan. It is normal to buy clothes one day and then throw them away after a few usages. Similarly, there are clothing programs that allow customers to rent clothes and send them back for different clothes every month. In many cases, when a product breaks we often feel relieved or happy because there is an opportunity to buy the most recent product version. When did we loose emotional attachment to our objects?
    Similarly, the recent changes in Data Science force Data Analysts (ie: Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, etc) to switch between different programming languages and environments. It is commonplace to make several temporary virtual machines for different computations, when in the past people cherished a single personalized work computational environment. One could perceive one's own pc as a "walkup workstation" that does not belong to them because the environment and information needs to constantly change. The need to switch between many different temporary environments that evolve quickly due to combined data from different data sources, may make one feel less emotionally connected to the tools (ie: PC, language, etc) because they are temporary structures. Human nature is to not become emotionally attached to something that may change. In many cases it may be emotionally healthy to put ownership distance between one's quickly evolving objects and one's self, if change is difficult. Ownership distance implies adopting a mindset that the objects will change and can be lost, preserving a memorable copy of the object like a backup file or photo may help.</p>

    <h2 id="observation12_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 12: The need for self rules and regulations</h2>

    <p id="observation12_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Asking who is to blame implies that one does not want to take responsibility for their action. The focus is on “who did it” instead of “why it happened” and how to prevent it from happening again. Focusing on the “who” does not solve the problem, nor does it create short-term planning to achieve long-term goals such that the problem does not occur. Focusing on the ”who” is a common default because it allows for the people involved to have a short-term solution and a sense of closure, such as payment for repairs, apologies, etc, but true closure is actually preventing the problems from reoccuring.
    Most people are not interested in short-term solutions and desire long-term solutions because prevention allows for future security; security is knowing that similar disasters/problems will not occur again. In Data Science, people look for the source of the problem and create organized workflows that prevent problems from occurring again such that long-term goals and short-term planning can establish long-term solutions. An effective workflow has steps and checks, using current and predicted information, that notify and/or correct problems before they even occur.</p>

    <h2 id="observation13_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 13: Acceptance of choices</h2>

    <p id="observation13_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">As technology and advancement improve, there are more options to choose from. More choice means more diversity in behaving, thinking, and living ; having more choice also fosters acceptance, encourages differences and responsibility.
    To choose something makes one more or less similar to someone else. One's intentions for choosing something makes the choice more or less self-responsible.
    If choice is so widely encouraged, why is there a need to embody the choices of someone else in order to feel accepted and part of a group? Society gives people more choice, but social acceptance rules encourage people to only follow the choices of people who are socially accepted. "High-school like" behavior, where large numbers of people choose the same things and embody a certain persona is commonplace for many trendy topics and/or communities. For example, copying influencer and/or YouTube personality behavior and/or appearance is considered normal. However, some people do not want to be someone else, and they are less well regarded.
    In my opinion, desire/acceptance of another person's/organization's personna means less self-reflection and unconscious rejection of one's existing personality and behavior on a certain level. Copying one's life after someone else can also imply inability to discern which attributes are attractive and desirable in the other person, such that one can develop those attributes within themselves using their own experiences. This implies a lack of self-understanding (ie: personal goals). Someone who is actively participating in their life needs to know one's self (ie: personality, competence, goals) and analyze/interpret new information with respect to their existing current state. The analysis process of one's self with new information is the step that encourages creativity. Copying and direct adoption of a persona and/or information avoids self-reflection and/or adaptation of current information and ideas.
    It is self-responsible to know why one wants to copy a trend, how it will help them grow individually, and how it will help them obtain an already set future goal. It may be more constructive to be motivated by the accomplishments of others, and then try/do the endeavors that they did with focus on one's own life, not the other person's life.</p>

    <h2 id="observation14_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 14: Identification of competence</h2>

    <p id="observation14_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">When observing advertised job announcements for the field of Data Science there appear to be two types of job posts: jobs that ask for highly specialized candidates to work in a small group, and jobs that welcome a less specialized larger group of candidates with varied backgrounds and skill levels. One would think that a larger group with diverse interests is likely to be unreliable for selecting skill competence, however in many situations companies recruit diversified individuals with the intention to train them for specific tasks. 
    Depending on the position, a list of skills are needed to be considered competent. If the position is difficult and requires technical and organizational abilities, the needed criteria quantity to demonstrate competence is likely to be longer than a less challenging position.
    Companies dictate what criteria quantity is necessary such that they find both competent and reliable candidates, despite having varying projects that may require knowledge of numerous skills. A reliable candidate is someone that can perform the required job tasks and thus have the ability to retain the same job for a long-period of time; a long-term competent employee.  A competent, and thus reliable candidate, is advantageous because hiring and firing employees that can not complete tasks is a waste of resources including: time, material, and human motivation/synergy. 
    From a candidate perspective, it is of interest to understand the required quantity of skills such that one is considered competent for specific jobs. Typically, degree programs prepare students with the needed quantity of skills for a field/job, however this information is less available and uncertain for individuals who have already graduated but are seeking a new job. There are many professional skills certificate programs after graduation, however again one is not certain of acquiring all the required skills for obtaining desired employment. In such an event, it is logical for seeking candidates with a degree to continually improve their skills while applying until they have found suitable employment; continued fulfillment of required company criteria via professional training is optimal to obtain employment. It would be less optimal or impossible for job applicants to find employment, with their current skills if companies did not accept them with their current credentials.</p>

    <h2 id="observation15_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 15: Irresponsible technologies that we all use - losing your life in spam/pub marketing to join causes</h2>

    <p id="observation15_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">There are technologies that we all use, that give and take control from our lives. Technology allows us to do more, but at the same time technology is not used in isolation. One person’s technological usage influences other people’s technological usage, whether it be a company releasing a product or a person posting a photo.
    On some level we are not free to use technology as we please because of our influential connections with other people. Depending on the group of people whom one is surrounded with, like social media or our environmental cluster (ie: family, friends), the same technological usage can bring success or destruction. When surrounding people see other people’s data, the surrounding people/cluster’s perception of the data creates and applies value to the success of the data. For this reason, being associated with the correct people aligned with one’s goals are important. Having associations with people or being a part of a group that does not value the same goals as your goals, will result in lack of success or no success because the opinions of the larger group will be aligned with their goals and not yours. Poorly aligned associations with respect to goals will create little to no success and result in misunderstandings, feelings of being used or victimhood, and even violence. Large groups of people misaligned with their proper long-term goals and abilities could even cause a population group of misplaced people in society.
    Current technologies may not help users to be optimally aligned with their interest groups. Technologies like Facebook and LinkedIn encourage using people outside of one’s cluster to gather new and exciting opportunities/information/data sources. A policy of mixing clusters could be destructive for someone with a small highly specialized cluster. The smaller cluster group would less likely have their goals fulfilled, and the larger/mixed group would not even fully understand the goals of the smaller group. The larger group interest would be focused on the superficial understanding of what the smaller group represents and not their actual goals and interests. 
    Spam and/or publicity received to join a cause could indicate that one may be part of a larger publicity association/group, by being a small member in a large group with varying interest than yours could potentially diminish the specialization of your individual group [citation]. The smaller/individual will be given information from the larger group, such that the smaller group will be more like them because in marketing, individuals that embody the cause of a group are likely to participate; the small group goal’s need to transform into the large group goal’s in order for the larger group to optimally succeed. Thankfully, there are more and more preferences and regulations that individual people can control with respect to an association, such that they can control the influence of the larger group on their existence. 
    The idea of being “lost in the cracks of the system” is the same phenomenon of being poorly aligned with individuals that do not have the same long-term work or life goals as oneself.</p>

    <h2 id="observation16_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 16: Technology that helps us to be our better selves</h2>

    <p id="observation16_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Many technologies are made in a way that adapts to the user such that it is easier for the user to operate the device, thus motivating usage of the technology. However, the natural usage of user inspired technology may not be optimal if it encourages violence, depression, and injustice. Human nature is both as kind as it can be cruel.
    It is commonplace to experience a social media discussion degrade into a non-neutral emotional state, where the topic of the conversation is not the focus. The purpose of using most communication technology is to gain insight on the subject of the conversation, not to be emotionally weighted down by distractions.
    Currently, technologies have mechanisms that block emotionally charged and/or offensive words/behavior, but there are no teaching mechanisms that help users to communicate in a more efficient and participatory manner. 
    In a fast paced society, many people are not aware of their optimal ability to communicate effectively, one does not really know what a truly enjoyable and/or effective conversation is until it has been experienced. 
    Negative thinking and/or practicing “dark humor”/sarcasm are small innocent behaviors that are easy to repeat, and cause one to have a limited range of emotional response and thus communication.</p>

If one is born into a family that excels/performs physical tasks for their professional career, like sports or outdoors activities, the children are likely to gain more experience in the activity and have an advantage for future success. Similarly, parents that work in technical fields or enjoy technical activities are likely to encourage their children to do more technical activities. In general, a family that has hobbies and participates in a diverse number of activities expose their children to more possible career choices. 
Also, many families use their social networking contacts, in an effort to expose their children to diverse data sources and future career paths. It is logical that as one increases exposure to more data sources, and thus experiences, one is likely to have more options and knowledge thus allowing for more success. Conversely, over exposure to too much information can be overwhelming and distracting, causing an inability to focus and thus achieve success.</p>

    <h2 id="observation18_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 18: Being the “Best”</h2>

    <p id="observation18_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Being the “Best” implies dominating the competition and being above others for a particular skill/task. Domination of others also implies isolation, because the talent puts one in a different category than the others around them.
In the past, there were few people who had education and so learned individuals progressed their skills in isolation, with very few peer interaction. However, in modern society where there are more educated people with high skill levels, is it advantageous to be the “Best” in isolation? Isolation would mean staying immersed with others who are not interested in learning and/or working at a high level on a certain skill.
It may be positive to be the “Best” in isolation, to have freedom to develop ideas if one has the personality to self-generate ideas alone. However, in general working with similarly interested people in a particular skill is: motivating and thus work is often completed faster, encourages rapid improvements and idea generation, encourages life balance and self-understanding because there are like-minded people to observe and give one perspective/context on their own life, choices, and actual skill level in the task. Having peers that are “Better” than yourself means that one can have realistic long-term goals aligned with the next level of expertise. In addition, the presence of someone highly skilled gives hope and motivation that ‘anything is possible’, in particular the problems encountered at a lower skill level.</p>

    <h2 id="observation19_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 19:  When playing is a Luxury</h2>

    <p id="observation19_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Enjoying one’s self after their basic needs have been satisfied signifies that one has the luxury to play. Playing could mean going on vacation, taking days off from work, or just allowing oneself to not have a task. In another indirect sense, "playing" could mean stalling or wasting time and/or ressources without any long-term plan or objective ; living in the moment and following events from moment-to-moment.
    Stalling life success or endeavors can be destructive if exaggerated beyond a certain limit because all things in life grow and evolve with time. Playing beyond a certain limit may not prepare one for the future or encourage one to excel; a stalled life means a life of unfulfilled hopes and dreams. Human life is limited to 65-100 years and there is only so much one can accomplish within the constraints of society. Playing is fun in the moment, but the experiences obtained from life advancement through work may be more rewarding and exciting because they are unknown experiences that are likely to enable deeper emotional states of "play". The unknown is intriguing because it is something rare amongst may repeated known experiences. "Playing" at the same stuck state in life signifies banal repetition of the same jokes and/or understanding of one's self and others; content with having nothing more interesting in life than the experiences already obtained. Constant play in the moment, without obtaining new experiences means "no future", a type of living death.
    The contents that one "plays'' with is the culmination of one's present intellectual capacity. The more one learns, the more interesting the "games'' are when one "plays". For this reason, purposeful "playing" is a luxury, and education is a basic life need; play is purposeful when basic life needs are satisfied before one has the luxury to play. Work and achievement are needed between periods of "play" to allow for continuous life and mental advancement, such that periods of "play" can be non-repetitive, interesting, and non-disruptive with work/life advancement.</p>

    <h2 id="observation20_h2" style='display:none; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -35px;'>Observation 20: Misclassification due to multiple meaning keywords (des faux amis)</h2>

    <p id="observation20_para_part0" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Ideas are not always communicated correctly, a poorly written or spoken phrase may convey misleading information to individuals and/or organizations (ie: groups). Misclassifying similar groups as the same subject can be both beneficial or detrimental for groups, depending on the size of the group as mentioned in Observation 15. For example, a small group, a person,  joining a large group, a job search site like, is likely to have their information overshadowed by the information of the large group (ie: job search recommendations of the information from peers/colleagues with respect to person’s profile), previously called misalignment meaning the person may receive large group related information that less related to their profile. In addition to misalignment, and regardless of group size, different groups can be given wrong information because they use shared keywords that have multiple meanings. For example, a Data Scientist can be misclassified as a Data Specialist because both groups use the keyword “model”. “Model” for a Data Scientist means Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms that predict an outcome based on data, however “model” or more specifically “data model” for a Data Specialist means the ingestion of datasets and connection of database tables via a primary key and/or secondary keys. The usage of “model” for these two groups signifies two completely different concepts. If a Data Scientist joined a group of Data Specialists because the word “model” was used on a job post ambiguously, the Data Scientist would quickly understand that they are in the wrong group because of familiar words used ambiguously. Thankfully, Data Scientist and Data Specialists work together and have shared overlapping tasks.
    However in fields where keywords include the general population, like art, misclassification may limit opportunity for above average trained/specialized people while providing opportunity for less trained people. The word “art” is loosely used for almost any act of creative painting and/or drawing, regardless of the artist's professional credentials. The work of a trained professional is called the same word as the work of a child, or an untrained talented criminal painting graffiti.  Novice and untrained participants are uplifted to obtain more knowledge about the general field of art because their knowledge is below average for the field. However, trained professionals with a level above average would receive known information and contacts, thus not encouraging advancement opportunities. This implies that it may be beneficial for professionally trained artists with a level above average to use more specialized keywords to dissociate themselves from the general population, to prevent receiving general non-advancing information due to misalignment and misclassification.</p>
