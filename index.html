  <p style="font-size:20px">[0] Consumer-2-Consumer/Consumer-2-Business (C2C/C2B) programming code seller</p>
  As I continue to look for full-time employment in Data Science, I made this GitHub organization called CodeSolutions2 to sell workflows/Data Science projects on UpWorks and/or independently. If you need a workflow for making a machine learning model, check out my Professional Blog! Web Application and Data Ingestion workflows are for sell at CodeSolutions2 and for free on my Professional Blog.

  <p style="font-size:20px">[2] Webapp Book: Observations of a Data Scientist</p>
  In a world where technological progress has connected people all over the world, one can observe strengths and weaknesses in others and realize that we all have similar experiences. This self-help book on 22 Data Science case studies discusses common topics ranging from disaster, long-term goals, self-esteem, and lack of technological regulatory rules. Insightful ideas and existing Data Science techniques are discussed as a possible way to solve everyday problems, such that people can be more educated, make better decisions, and live their ‚Äúhappy life‚Äù. Five key self-help activities on goal achievement, self-sabotage, decision making, and overcoming unwanted emotions are given so that readers can empower their own lives.

  <p style="font-size:20px">[3] Machine Learning/Deep Learning webapps</p>
  Seeing a model predict a result directly from data allows for others to better understand their data, thus allowing for data insights to be found!

  <p style="font-size:20px">[4] Google Apps Scripts webapps</p>
  I started writing web applications using Google Apps Scripts, using JavaScript, HTML, and Google Script programming languages, because it was convenient to connect the webapps to cloud services such as Gmail, Drive, and BigQuery. Below are several webapps and/or scripts that I made using Google Apps Script:
  <ul>

  <p style="font-size:20px">[5] Formatted Case Study Reports</p>
  A classical reporting format of formal Data Analytics projects. It is important to have a document clearly explaining the goals, expectations/requirements, and measurable deliverables of success for a project, in order to have a stable, calm, and productive working environment. These case study reports using Google Analytics organization are formatted such that clear, logical, and understandable projects are created and executed with team success (even if the results are less desirable); working as a team and following logical short-term and long-term goals creates eventual success.
