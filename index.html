As I continue to look for full-time employment in Data Science, I made this GitHub organization called CodeSolutions2 to sell workflows/Data Science projects on UpWorks and/or independently. If you need a workflow for making a machine learning model, check out my Professional Blog! Web Application and Data Ingestion workflows are for sell at CodeSolutions2 and for free on my Professional Blog.

<p style="font-size:20px">[3] <a id="redirect link" href="https://github.com/j622amilah/Case_Studies">Formatted Case Study Reports</a></p>
A classical reporting format of formal Data Analytics projects. It is important to have a document clearly explaining the goals, expectations/requirements, and measurable deliverables of success for a project, in order to have a stable, calm, and productive working environment. These case study reports using Google Analytics organization are formatted such that clear, logical, and understandable projects are created and executed with team success (even if the results are less desirable); working as a team and following logical short-term and long-term goals creates eventual success.
