  <p style="font-size:20px">[1] Webapp Book: Observations of a Data Scientist</p>
  In a world where technological progress has connected people all over the world, one can observe strengths and weaknesses in others and realize that we all have similar experiences. This self-help book on 22 Data Science case studies discusses common topics ranging from disaster, long-term goals, self-esteem, and lack of technological regulatory rules. Insightful ideas and existing Data Science techniques are discussed as a possible way to solve everyday problems, such that people can be more educated, make better decisions, and live their ‚Äúhappy life‚Äù. Five key self-help activities on goal achievement, self-sabotage, decision making, and overcoming unwanted emotions are given so that readers can empower their own lives.

  <p style="font-size:20px">[4] Formatted Case Study Reports</p>
  A classical reporting format of formal Data Analytics projects. It is important to have a document clearly explaining the goals, expectations/requirements, and measurable deliverables of success for a project, in order to have a stable, calm, and productive working environment. These case study reports using Google Analytics organization are formatted such that clear, logical, and understandable projects are created and executed with team success (even if the results are less desirable); working as a team and following logical short-term and long-term goals creates eventual success.

  Maintaining a clean and organized code notebook can be transformed direcctly to a report using pdf/html rendering tools. Here I tested different ways to render a notebook to html for website sharing, this method would be more useful if a reporting template was used to render a concsistant reporting format.
